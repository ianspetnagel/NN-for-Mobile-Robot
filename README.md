# NN-for-Mobile-Robot
Arduino Uno Rev3, Ardunio IDE, C++:
This is the code I used to build the feed forward Neural Network for machine learning and decision making of an obstacle avoidance mobile robot. Fall 2023.
There is also the previous version (no NN), hard coded obstacle avoidance decision making file in this repo. Spring 2023
The mobile robot also had an LED screen, ultrasonic distance sensors for obstacle detection, watchdog timer for ON/OFF standby mode functionality
